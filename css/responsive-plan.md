# Responsive Design Improvement Plan

## Information Gathered:
- The `index.html` file is structured with Bootstrap's grid system, which is good for responsiveness.
- The `css/style.css` file includes media queries for various breakpoints, ensuring that styles adapt to different screen sizes.
- The navbar and hero sections have specific styles for mobile views, but further adjustments may be needed for optimal performance.

## Plan:
1. **HTML Adjustments**:
   - Ensure that all Bootstrap classes are correctly applied to elements in `index.html` for responsiveness.
   - Check for any fixed widths or heights that may hinder responsiveness and replace them with relative units (e.g., percentages, `vw`, `vh`).

2. **CSS Adjustments**:
   - Review and refine media queries in `css/style.css` to ensure they cover all necessary breakpoints.
   - Add any missing styles for mobile views, particularly for elements that may not be displaying correctly on smaller screens.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the website on various devices and screen sizes to ensure that all elements are responsive and visually appealing.
   - Make adjustments as necessary based on testing feedback.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the changes outlined in the plan.
- Conduct thorough testing on multiple devices to ensure responsiveness.
